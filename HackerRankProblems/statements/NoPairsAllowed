You have a boutique tha specializes in words that don't have adjacent matching characters.
Bobby, a competitor, has decided to get out of the word business altogether and you have bought his inventory.

You idea is to modify his inventory of words so they are suitable for sale in your store.
To do this, you find all adjacent pairs of matching characters and replace one of the characters with a different one.

Determine the minimum number of characters that must be replaced to make a salable word.

For example, you purchased words = [add,book,break]. You will create an array with your results from tests.
Change d in add, change o in book and no change is necessary in break. The return array result = [1,1,0].
